# ProtoTracer: 3D Rendering and Animation Engine

ProtoTracer is a real-time 3D rendering and animation engine designed for microcontrollers. While it has broad applicability, this is a project made for free and it will be down to you to customize support for other hardware other than the examples provided. Support for other microcontrollers may be possible through custom implementations, but users should be prepared to develop their own adaptations if working with platforms other than the Teensy 4/4.1.

ProtoTracer supports:
- **64x32 HUB75 panels**
- **Custom panel designs based on WS2812B LEDs - WS35 Boards**

## Experimental: Adafruit Matrix Portal S3 (ESP32-S3)

This fork includes an **experimental** build target for the [Adafruit Matrix Portal S3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5778) with **two 64×32 HUB75 panels** chained on the onboard HUB75 connector (`env:matrixportal_s3` in `platformio.ini`). It was added as a **hardware bring-up test** using the ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA driver.

The test was **conclusive** (display, menu, microphone path, and firmware stability were verified) but **disappointing for real-time use**: the main Protogen face animation was observed at about **15 FPS** with a full red material, with software ray-tracing dominating frame time. For a responsive Protogen face, **a Teensy 4.0 or 4.1 remains the recommended platform**; treat the Matrix Portal S3 port as a curiosity or starting point, not a drop-in performance match for the Teensy builds.

## Important Note
This project is complex and requires prior experience with microcontroller projects. If you're new to microcontrollers or seeking an easier solution, consider alternatives like:
- **Huidu WF-1**
  - 🗸 RGB, works with HUB75 panels
  - 🗸 Easy Wi-Fi configuration, quick setup with an app
  - ❌ Limited to static images, GIFs, and slideshows
  - ❌ No interactivity with sensors or buttons
- **MAX7219-based Protogen Designs**
  - 🗸 Affordable and widely available
  - 🗸 Compatible with Arduino Nano or similar controllers
  - 🗸 Interactive depending on firmware
  - 🗸 Low power consumption compared to HUB75 designs
  - ❌ Single-color, on/off pixels only
  - ❌ Requires significant soldering


# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can this project work on other microcontrollers?
- **Yes, but only the Teensy 4.0 and 4.1 are officially supported.** Users can develop custom implementations for other microcontrollers, but this requires in-depth technical expertise.

## Will this project work on a Raspberry Pi?
- **No**, ProtoTracer is not designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, but could be ported.

## Will this project work on an ESP32?
- **Only experimentally in this fork**: an Adafruit Matrix Portal S3 + dual HUB75 configuration is supported as a PlatformIO environment for testing. Performance is far below the Teensy 4.x builds (on the order of **~15 FPS** for the default face in testing). For a practical build, use **Teensy 4.0 / 4.1**. Upstream ProtoTracer targets Teensy only unless you maintain your own port.

## Will this project work on an Arduino Nano/Uno/Mega?
- **No**, ProtoTracer cannot practically run on these platforms due to hardware limitations.


# Demonstration

Here’s an example showcasing ProtoTracer's capabilities, demonstrating live rendering of a textured and rotating `.OBJ` file:

# Recommended Platform Requirements

- **Microcontroller (recommended):** Teensy 4.0 or Teensy 4.1
- **Microcontroller (experimental, this fork only):** Adafruit Matrix Portal S3 — supported for development and testing; **not recommended** if you care about frame rate versus the Teensy reference.
- **Panels:** Two 64x32 HUB75 panels or WS35 LED boards
- **Shield:** SmartMatrix V4 LED Shield, OctoWS2811 board, or ProtoController V2 (coming soon)

ProtoTracer has been tested on a Teensy 4.0 using a 2,000-triangle scene with a 4,096-pixel matrix.


# Usage

To get started with ProtoTracer, refer to the [ProtoTracer Documentation](https://coelacant1.github.io/ProtoTracer). It provides detailed instructions on:
- Importing files
- Setting up controllers
- Manipulating objects
- Rendering to displays


# Customization

While ProtoTracer is designed for the Teensy 4 series, advanced users can create custom controllers for other microcontrollers. This requires a deep understanding of the codebase and the target microcontroller's capabilities. Refer to the [documentation](https://coelacant1.github.io/ProtoTracer) for guidance.
